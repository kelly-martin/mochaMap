Keep track of your coffee shops: the ones you've visited, your favorites, and those on your bucket list. 
This app was built using data from the Google Maps and Google Places APIs. User-added data is stored in 
a MySQL database table. PHP scripts are called to add, update, and fetch data from the database. AJAX is 
used to call these PHP scripts; any data returned is in XML format and is parsed before use.
